This mod is a Data-Driven solution created for Modpack Developers to create their own materials, unify the look and feel of modded Minecraft, and provides them with a handful of feature generation options.

All blocks, and items have been properly tagged, and have all the basic recipes included upon their material's registration.

Additional information on how to setup new Materials, configure new Strata Blocks to be used for dynamic ores, and generating Deposit features can be found on the Wiki.
